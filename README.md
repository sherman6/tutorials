# Tutorials
###### Tutorials on various topics related to data analysis and coding

___

Welcome to the tutorials repository.  Here, I will demonstrate tips and tricks which will hopefully help others troubleshoot code in various programming languages.

## Purpose:

As much as I can, I'll show examples of things that __don't__ work, and explain the resulting error messages. In my experience, seeing examples of __<font color='maroon'>"the wrong way"</font>__ to code is just as educational as seeing __<font color='green'>"the right way"</font>__ to code.  In modern coding languages, there is often more than one way to achieve something, and therefore often multiple ways to get stuck â˜¹.  

These tutorials are designed to be __broad, rather than deep__, and are __not designed to be exhaustive__, but rather to help troubleshoot common problems and error messages you might encounter.  This is because while there are some great documentation and tutorials out there, I find myself jumping from one resource to the next, until I have dozens of browser tabs open, as each focuses _very in-depth_ on a specific command, library, function, or variable type.

More topics will be added soon (as my time allows).

### Resources for additional information:

I've spent my fair share of hours Googling, Stack Overflow-ing, and GitHub-ing to find solutions, as well as a decent amount of time on some very informative and robust free tutorial websites.  There are many out there, and more pop up every week - it's a very collaborative community.  

But if you're looking for a place to get started, here are a few good bets (this list is by no means exhaustive): 

#### General resources for troubleshooting and solutions:

I intend to add to this repository as timing allows, and to address recurring topics or popular questions. Thanks!
